* **Requested PHP extension dom is missing from your system**

Installing xml-extension (php7.0-xml in my case) solved the problem

Managed to fix it with a php version 5.6*

```
$ sudo apt-get install php5.6-xml
```

```
sudo apt-get install php-mbstring

Migrations also allow you to roll back the most recent changes that you made to a database.
