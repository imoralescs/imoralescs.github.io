## Local Enviroment Notes

* **No application encryption key has been specified. New Laravel app**

```
$ php artisan key:generate
```

* **Permission denied**

```
$ sudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/directory
```

* **Restart, Start, Stop MySQL from the Command Line Linux**

On Linux start/stop/restart from the command line:

```
 /etc/init.d/mysqld start
 /etc/init.d/mysqld stop
 /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
```

Some Linux flavours offer the service command too

```
 service mysqld start
 service mysqld stop
 service mysqld restart
```

or

```
service mysql start
service mysql stop
service mysql restart
```

* **Requested PHP extension dom is missing from your system**

Installing xml-extension (php7.0-xml in my case) solved the problem

```
sudo apt-get install php-xml
```

Managed to fix it with a php version 5.6*

```
$ sudo apt-get install php5.6-xml
```

* **Requested PHP extension mbstring is missing from your system**

```
sudo apt-get install php-mbstring 
```

* **Laravel 5 Failed opening required bootstrap/../vendor/autoload.php**

```
composer update --no-scripts
```

### `package.json`

### app

App directory contains the main code for any application. Almost all of the classes in your app will be in the directory. It is further divided in following sub directory:

* **app -> Console**

Place you can extend Artisan command. This contain custom artisan commands for the application

* **app -> Http**

This directory contain controllers & middleware. They are placed in their respective directories. Before on Laravel 5.2 route file is placed in this directory too, but after Laravel 5.2 they create a routes directory outside of app directory.

* **app -> Providers**

* **app -> User.php**

* **Other directory**

These directories come in each new version of Laravel prior to 5.3 but are often not used, so all new installs won't have them. Here's the list of folders that are going away: **Events**, **Jobs**, **Listeners**, **Policies**.

### bootstrap

* **database -> migration**

Laravel migrations provide mechanisms for creating and modifying database tables. Migrations are database agnostic. This means you do not have to worry about the specific SQL syntax for the database engine that you are creating tables for. Migrations also allow you to roll back the most recent changes that you made to a database.

### public

### resources
