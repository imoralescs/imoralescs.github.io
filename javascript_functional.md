# Javascript Functional

Is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

Is all about decomposing a problem into a set of functions. Often, functions are chained together, nested within each other, passed around, and treated as first-class citizens.

## Script Tag

Everything start with where we write the Javascript code to be execute. The script tag is used for specifying JavaScript which should run in a web page. A script tag can either include the JavaScript directly, or it can point to a URL where the script should be loaded from. Script tags are executed in the order they appear.
