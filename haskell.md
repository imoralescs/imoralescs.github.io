## Expressions

Everything in Haskell is an expression or declaration. Expression may be values, combination of values and/or function applied to value. In almost all programming languages you can create expressions such as:

```
(b*b-4*a*c)/2*a
```

and you can assign these expressions to variables:

```
v = (b*b-4*a*c)/2*a
```
