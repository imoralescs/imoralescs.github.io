React is a Javascript library for creating user interfaces, authored by Facebook and Instagram engineers. Itâ€™s aimed to solve the challenges involved when developing complex user interfaces with datasets that change over time.

### React is all about components

Components are the core of React and the view to your application. They are encapsulated and composable, you can mix and match them to build complex UIs favoring code reuse and separation of concerns.

React components are written in plain JavaScript, instead of template languages or the HTML directives traditionally used for web application UIs.
